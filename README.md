# Analogs of Future Climate in Chinese Cities Identified in Present Observations

Climatic analogs are an effective method used to measure the similarity between two climate scenarios. 
By mapping a given climate scenario to another, familiar climate scenario and measuring their similarity, complex climate prediction models can be simplified and made easier to understand. 
In this study, we used climatic analogs of 378 cities in China and the suitable future climate area of China to study climatic novelty in China.
